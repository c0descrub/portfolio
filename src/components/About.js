          I began my journey as a web developer in 2015, when I decided to
          enroll onto the web design course at my college. The course taught me
          the basics of HTML & CSS, and introduced me to core web concepts like
          Content Management Systems and the existence of Javascript. After
          finishing my studies, I continued web development as a hobby; however
          at that time, I never took the first step into my career.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Since leaving my studies, I've continued to slowly improve on that
          foundation, coding in my spare time. I've come a long way in that
          time, and I'm proud of what I've managed to achieve on my own.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          I'm now at a point in my life where I'm ready to take that first step
          into my dream career.
